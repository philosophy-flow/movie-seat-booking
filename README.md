This is a vanilla JavaScript application that simulates letting a user select a
movie at a certain ticket price, and then select a number of seats within a
movie theater.

The application shows the number of seats selected and a total price.

The data is stored in localStorage so that a user can pick up where they left off
after refreshing the page.
